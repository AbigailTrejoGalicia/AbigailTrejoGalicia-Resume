        <div class="subheading mb-5">Chicano StudiesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a full time student at the University of California, Riverside majoring in Chicano Studies aspiring to be an Immigration Lawyer. In addition to being a student I am also a part time worker at a local coffee shop where I love to talk to customers and bring a smile to their face. Though my life might seem stressful, I always find time to give back to the community as a way to say thank you for all the support and love they have given me. I grew up in a predominantly Hispanic community where everyone was always struggling to meet ends but they never made it noticeable. I come from a family who taught me what it is to challenge myself and rise above others as a way of survival. Motivation was key when it came to trying to succeed and break the barriers that were placed in my community by society. The education system never supported children nor motivated them to achieve a higher education. Being able to watch my parents and community try to help their children succeed has always been an eye opener. This was only the beginning and to say the least a great start to my life.<br><br>

        Life during college. As a second year student, I have tried to socialize and make friends via clubs-organization but none have caught my attention like The Women's Network. I am currently part of the mentorship committee where I am able to bring girls together and help them have confidence when it comes to their careers. We are often taught as females that men are always going to be the ones with power but with TWN we show women how they should not be afraid to speak up and be ambitious. As a mentor I am able to work with other members and help them out with the essentials such as starting a LinkedIn account. Although this might seem like basic information, one of the most important parts to reaching out to employers and companies is to make sure you have a well presented profile that they can easily read through. The program is not only about the professional world and building connections but also to meet people who are also on the same path as you. Building friendships during college is one of the most important things besides your academic achievement and that is something this organization has taught me.<br><br>

        As I prepare to graduate for college in the next two years, I have a lot to think about when it comes to my career. The only plans I currently have is to pass my LSAT with a high score and be able to apply to law schools. Although this seems like a long way from now I am really excited for what awaits me soon
